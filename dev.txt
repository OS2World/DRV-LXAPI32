1 Introduction
==============
This document lists all the needed tools and compilers to build the lxapi32
OS/2 device driver.
It also tries to give some informations about the architecture of the driver
and explain some technical details.

2 Required tools
================
- Watcom C/C++ version 11.0c
- ALP 4.x (IBM assembler; comes with ddk)
- IBM OS/2 DDK (http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk/)
  - Base header/libraries/tools (combase.zip)
  - MMPM/2 base (mmpmdd.zip)
  - PDD & MMPM/2 driver reference
  - ILINK.EXE and ILIB.EXE
  - Innotek's GCC compiler beta 3
  - EMX make utilities

3 Recommended tools for debugging
=================================
- ICAT debugger (follow link from IBM DDK page)
- OS/2 Debug kernel

4 Building the driver
=====================
You need some environment variables for build:
DDK        Path to DDK
LXAPI32DEV Path to LXAPI32
GCC        Path to Innoteks GCC (currently gcc-3.2.2-beta3.zip)
EMXUTILS   Path to EMX utilities (make, touch, etc.)

You can build the driver from the main directory by executing:
build.cmd
This will create the debug version of the driver.
Parameters to build.cmd:
clean   Clean up all directories
release Make release version (without debug)
debug   Make debug version (default)
all     Rebuild all files

5 LXAPI32 driver architecture
=============================
LXAPI32 contains a lot of Linux function calls.

6 Important notes
=================
16/32 Bit segments
------------------
All public symbols in 16 Bit segments must not begin with an underscore (_).
The GCSyms.cmd script will parse the map file and place all public symbols
beginning with an underscore (_) into the kallsym table. If there are 16 Bit
public symbols with an underscore (_) at the beginning tha call trace will
not work correctly.
